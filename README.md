# Interpreter Part 1
<br />
50 points: Works on all operators and statements. Clearly delineates env functions, "M_env" functions, and "M_value" functions. The value functions correctly return the value of an expression. The env functions correctly determine the new env. env functions correctly insert, update, and lookup.
<br />5 points: Uses abstraction through out
<br />30 points: Excellent functional style
<br />10 points: Correctly returns integers or true and false
<br />5 points: Nicely readible code: good indentation, well organized functions, well named functions and parameters, clear comments.
